      </header>

      <main className="flex-1 flex flex-col gap-6 lg:gap-8">
        <p>For years, I was just an average student. Not bad, not great. Without putting in much effort, I consistently scored around 11 or 12 out of 20 throughout middle school and high school. I was coasting. But everything changed once I got to university.</p>
        <p>I started playing the game differently. Not by working harder than everyone else â€” but by working smarter. And without cheating, without burning out, I ended up in the top 10% of my class.</p>
        <p>Here are the 3 simple techniques â€” almost like glitches in the system â€” that helped me do it.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">1. Study the Class Before the Class</h2>
        <p>Most professors reuse their lectures every year. Same slides, same examples, same explanations â€” sometimes even the exact same wording.</p>
        <p>So my first tactic was simple: get ahead.</p>
        <p>I got hold of notes from a student who had already taken the same classes the year before. Before each lecture, I would skim through the upcoming chapter. Five to ten minutes the night before â€” thatâ€™s all it took.</p>
        <p>Once I was in class, everything felt familiar. The professor's explanations sounded like dÃ©jÃ  vu. I could predict what was coming next.</p>
        <p>When they asked questions, I already had answers â€” not because I was a genius, but because I had seen it before.</p>
        <p>That made class participation feel natural, and my understanding much deeper. Some might call it cheating â€” but to me, itâ€™s just being prepared.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">2. Past Exams Are a Cheat Code</h2>
        <p>Just like lectures, exams donâ€™t change much from year to year.</p>
        <p>Once I realized that, I started collecting previous yearsâ€™ exams â€” sometimes even with answer keys or graded copies.</p>
        <p>What I found was simple: If you can solve last yearâ€™s test, youâ€™ll most likely crush this yearâ€™s.</p>
        <p>The numbers may change. The wording might be slightly different. But the structure, themes, and logic? Often exactly the same.</p>
        <p>So before finals, Iâ€™d train with old exams. Not only was it the best prep â€” it also removed most of the surprise and stress.</p>
        <p>It was like rehearsing before a performance. And when the real show came, I was ready.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">3. Learn by Teaching: Smart Group Work</h2>
        <p>This last strategy is powerful â€” and completely underrated: learn by teaching.</p>
        <p>Most people think group study means wasting time chatting with friends. But when done right, it becomes a massive accelerator.</p>
        <p>Hereâ€™s how: You form a small group. Each person chooses a topic to study deeply. Then, when you meet, you teach each other.</p>
        <p>Explaining something out loud forces you to truly understand it. You canâ€™t fake it. Youâ€™re forced to structure your thoughts and make sense of what you know.</p>
        <p>It also creates a feedback loop:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>If you can explain it clearly, youâ€™ve mastered it.</li>
          <li>If you get confused while talking, you know where you need to review.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bonus: itâ€™s more fun and way less isolating than studying alone.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6">ðŸ§  Conclusion: School Is a Game. Learn to Play It.</h2>
        <p>This isnâ€™t about cheating or taking shortcuts. Itâ€™s about understanding the system and using it strategically.</p>
        <p>You donâ€™t need to work all night or memorize textbooks blindly. You just need to study smarter, focus on what matters, and prepare in a way that gives you the upper hand.</p>
        <p>Success at school isnâ€™t just about talent or intelligence â€” itâ€™s about approach. And the methods you use here can follow you far beyond the classroom.</p>
        <p>So instead of letting the system test you... Test the system. Prepare like a strategist. Play the long game. And turn your education into your personal victory.</p>
